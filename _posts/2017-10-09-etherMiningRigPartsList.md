Lately I've taken an interest in cryptocurrency mining and today I thought I'd share with you a detailed parts list so you have all the knowledge you need to build your own miner. 
I built my first Ethereum mining rig a couple months ago and it was the first computer I had ever built myself. 
It was a lot of fun and I quickly became interested in the hardware side of computing apposed to the software side.
I made plenty of mistakes building the first mining rig so I wanted to document my parts list and hopefully pass on some knowledge to others out there interested in cryptocurrency mining.
