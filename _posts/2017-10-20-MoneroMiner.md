Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency focused around privacy, decentralization and scalability.
It was created in April of 2014 and has since seen a huge uptick in adoption.

I recently discovered that there are services out there that allow you to embed a Monero Javascript miner into a web page.
I thought this was an interesting idea and had to try it out for myself. Is it easy to do? How efficient is it? How can it be utulized?

**The page you are on is currently utilizing your CPU to mine Monero.**
