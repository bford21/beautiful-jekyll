Lately I've taken an interest in cryptocurrency mining and today I thought I'd share with you a detailed parts list so you have all the knowledge you need to build your own miner. 
I built my first Ethereum mining rig a couple months ago and it was the first computer I had ever built myself. 
It was a lot of fun and I quickly became interested in the hardware side of computing apposed to the software side.
I made plenty of mistakes building the first mining rig so I wanted to document my parts list and hopefully pass on some knowledge to others out there interested in cryptocurrency mining.

### Graphics Cards
Which graphics cards you use is the most important and also most expensive part of a build. For this build I'll be using 4 AMD Radeon RX580 Nitro+ OC 4gb cards. 
AMD RX and R9 series cards are among the most popular due to the combination of price/hashrate/wattage. 
You need atleast 4gb of memory per card but the more the better. You will see slightly better hashrates on 8gb cards than 4gb ones. 

The hashrate on different cards is going to vary greatly so do your research before purchasing any cards. 
<a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/">CryptoCompare</a> is a good resource for researching the hashrates/wattages for various cards. 
Cards that are efficient for mining are in extremely high demand at the moment so finding them might be difficult. <a href="http://www.nowinstock.net/">Nowinstock.net</a> is a great site for getting alerts when cards become available.

### CPU
No need for an expensive CPU. An intel Celeron or Pentium will do. Just make sure to note the socket type (1150 vs 1151)
For this build I bought an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015VPX05A/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1" >Intel Pentium 1151</a>.
