 The Crime Incident Report dataset released by the Boston Police Department details all the crimes commited in the city of Boston. I found this data on the city of Bostons website, CityofBoston.gov and was suprised by how much was openly available to the public.
 
 I had always wanted to write a web app to visualize a data set and thought it would be interesting to plot each crime where it took place on a map using the google maps API. 
 Implementing features like search and filtering allows users to easily visualize a dataset of their choosing.
