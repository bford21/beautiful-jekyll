 The Crime Incident Report dataset released by the Boston Police Department details all the crimes commited in the city of Boston between July of 2012 and August of 2015. 
 I found this data on the city of Bostons website, <a href="https://data.cityofboston.gov/">CityofBoston.gov</a> and was surprised by how much was openly available to the public.
 
 I had always wanted to write a web app to visualize a set of data and thought it would be interesting to plot each crime where it took place on a map using the google maps API. 
 Implementing features like search and filtering allows users to easily visualize the dataset of their choosing. 
 
 Languages Used: **Javascript, JQuery, JSON, HTML, CSS**

### Future Feature List
1. Update to pull from latest dataset which is updated through July 21, 2017
2. Add additional filters (crime, weapon, street)
3. Add ability to search between 2 specific dates
 
Reccomend me a feature you'd like to see in the comments!
