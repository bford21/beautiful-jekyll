subtitle: What I'm all about
---

Hello, my name is Brian Ford and I am passionate about technology. I love exploring new technology and learning how to apply it in order to solve problems. I am constantly looking for new challenges. I enjoy working outside my comfort zone and continuing to learn new languages and development techniques.

I was first introduced to programming when I was 13. I learned how to write Java code in order to automate myself playing an online game. Empowered with this new realization that you can make your computer work for **YOU** by writing code. I've since set out on a journey of exploration and innovation.
 
When I'm not programming I like to get outside and explore the great city of Boston. I grew up just outside the city and am a huge Patriots, Red Sox and Celtics fan. I also enjoy snowboarding, running and biking.
