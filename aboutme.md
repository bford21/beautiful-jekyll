subtitle: What I'm all about

Hello, my name is Brian Ford and I am a passionate about technology. I love exploring new technology to learn how I can solve problems  and am constantly looking for new challenges. I enjoy working outside my comfort zone and continuing to learn new languages and development techniques. When I'm not programming I like to get outside and explore the great city of Boston. I also enjoy snowboarding, running and biking.
BFord.net serves as a portfolio for all my most recent projects and the occasional blog post about something I find interesting. I enjoy teaching people how to program almost as much as I like to program myself, so I hope to one day include a tutorials section as well.
