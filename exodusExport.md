If you are serious about securing your cryptocurrency than it is very import you keep your private keys to yourself and backed up.
In this post I'll show you how to export your private keys from a software wallet that I use called Exodus.

### What is Exodus

<a href="https://www.exodus.io/">Exodus</a> is a free software wallet that I personally reccomend for keeping your crypto assets safe.
It does not store your private keys and supports a wide array of crypto assets. 
It currently supports Aragon, Augur, BAT, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Civic, Dash, Decred, EOS, ETH Classic, Ethereum, Gnosis, Golem, Litecoin, OmiseGo and SALT.
