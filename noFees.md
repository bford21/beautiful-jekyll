There are plenty of exchanges out there to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The majority of which charge a fee for using there services. 

Today I want to show you a trick to buying Bitcoin without having to pay any fees. 

### Exchange

The exchange we'll be purchasing from is called <a href="https://www.gdax.com">GDAX.com</a>.
The company that owns GDAX is also the same company that owns <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5937469e2e23290201b06a76">Coinbase.</a>
