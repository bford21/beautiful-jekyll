Publish-Over-Onedrive is an in progress open source Jenkins plugin based on publish-to-ftp and extends the open source publish-to and basic-credentials projects. 
This Jenkins plugin publishes artifacts in a post build step to Onedrive folders without the need to run a sync client on your build server.

Although this project is incomplete at the moment, this was an excellent learning opportunity for me. This was my first introduction to querying API's with Java, as well as learning how to authenticate using the OAuth standard.

Languages Used: **Java**
